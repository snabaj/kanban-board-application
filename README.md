## Description

The **Kanban Board Application** allows users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their work tasks efficiently. It integrates authentication with **JWT** to protect user sessions and securely store credentials in a PostgreSQL database.

### Key Features:

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up with a username and password, which are stored in the database and authenticated using JWT.
- **Secure Login:** Users log in with credentials, and upon successful authentication, they are redirected to the Kanban board.
- **Task Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete task tickets for better workflow organization.
- **Persistent Sessions:** JWT ensures secure session management with automatic expiration handling.
- **Logout Mechanism:** Users can securely log out, invalidating their session.
